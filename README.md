AddBoard
========

A board game with numbers in each space, when the player moves into that space they have to move that number of spaces in that direction. They must think about the positioning of the numbers on the board to reach the goal on the board.

Installation
=============

It's currently buggy on the installation. Run it from terminal using python testgame.py. It's fully functional from terminal.
